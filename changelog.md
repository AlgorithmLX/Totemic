First release for Minecraft 1.20.1. This version should work with both Forge and NeoForge, but NeoForge compatibility is
not guaranteed for 1.20.1. Not everything has been thoroughly tested yet, so issues might still occur.
Please don't hesitate to report problems to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/TeamTotemic/Totemic/issues).

Loading worlds from Totemic 1.19.2-0.12.10 appears to be working, but as always, making a world backup is recommended.

The Totempedia is available if Patchouli is also installed. Unlike in 1.19.2 so far, Patchouli is no longer required,
but I would recommend having the Totempedia handy.

Most of the basic recipes that used to be unlocked when obtaining the Totempedia are now instead unlocked by the Totem
Whittling Knife.
