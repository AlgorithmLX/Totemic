- Fixed not being able to unlock the Totempedia entries in the Music Instruments category.
  
Should an entry still be locked even though you have the instrument's crafting recipe, make sure that you also have the corresponding advancement, e.g. by using the command `/advancement grant <username> only totemic:recipes/misc/<instrument>`, or by placing a block of Red Cedar Leaves, a Buffalo Tooth, a Red Cedar Log or an Eagle Bone in your inventory, depending on the instrument.
