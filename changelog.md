This is an early release for Minecraft 1.20.4 with NeoForge. From now on, we will be targeting NeoForge rather than Forge.

I haven't tested everything thoroughly and NeoForge is still unstable, so issues may occur.
Loading worlds from Totemic 1.19.2-0.12.9 appears to be working, but as always, making a world backup is highly recommended.
If you encounter any problems, please don't hesitate to report them to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/TeamTotemic/Totemic/issues).

As Patchouli for NeoForge is still work in progress as of now, the Totempedia is not available yet. Most of the basic crafting
recipes are instead unlocked when obtaining a Totem Whittling Knife.
