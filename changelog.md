This update is aimed at making selecting Ceremonies more intuitive and providing more control to modpack makers and server owners. If you want to prevent players from changing the weather or climbing all over the place, now you can.

- Playing an instrument in selection mode will now preferably target Totem Bases that already have a selection on them. This makes it more feasible to perform Ceremonies in areas where multiple Totem Poles are placed near each other.
- Totem Bases will now emit particles when in selection mode.
- Added a config option to disable individual Ceremonies.
- Added a config option to disable individual Totem Carvings.
- Added a tooltip to Totem Pole and Base items visible with advanced tooltips enabled (F3+H) showing the Totem Carving and Wood Type registry IDs.

The config options can be found in the server config, which for Minecraft 1.20.4+ is located in the usual `config` folder (keep in mind that the server config file is not created on the client until a world is loaded).
