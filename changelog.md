- Added Red Cedar Hanging Sign
- Added missing crafting recipes for Red Cedar Wood and Stripped Red Cedar Wood (aka bark blocks)
- Now requires at least NeoForge version 20.4.167 (stable release)
- Missing texture entries for a Totem Pole wood type in a resource pack will now cause its Totem Poles to have missing textures rather than Red Cedar textures
- Added missing block names for Dummy Tipi and Potted Red Cedar Sapling
- Internal changes to how the Jingle Dress works. The behavior should be unchanged.
