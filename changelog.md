- Patchouli is no longer required for Totemic
  - Consequently, the unlocking conditions for some of the crafting recipes were changed. Most of the basic recipes are now unlocked when you obtain a Totem Whittling Knife, whose recipe is in turn unlocked by iron ingots.
- Added missing crafting recipes for Red Cedar Wood and Stripped Red Cedar Wood (aka bark blocks)
- Missing texture entries for a Totem Pole wood type in a resource pack will now cause its Totem Poles to have missing textures rather than Red Cedar textures
- Added missing block names for Dummy Tipi and Potted Red Cedar Sapling
